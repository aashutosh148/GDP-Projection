While this tool uses data primarily sourced from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), please note the following:

- The data may not always be the most up-to-date or consistent across all countries.
- Some countries may have data only up to 2022 or 2023, rather than 2024.
- The projections are based on historical data and user-defined growth rates, and should not be considered as official forecasts.
- Economic projections are subject to numerous uncertainties and external factors not accounted for in this simplified model.

This tool is intended for educational and illustrative purposes only. For the most accurate and up-to-date economic data and projections, please refer to official sources such as the IMF, World Bank, or relevant national statistical offices.
